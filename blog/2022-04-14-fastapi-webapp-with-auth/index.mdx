I have recently been exploring how to use FastAPI to build web apps. Check out this recent blog post [How to create a FastAPI Web App with MongoDB and Beanie](../2022-03-18-fastapi-beanie-one-page/index.mdx). One area I have found difficult is configuring authentication for web apps in FastAPI. The FastAPI [security docs](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/security/) are really good, however they focus only on securing API endpoints, and not how to implement security for a web app.

## Tl/DR

All of the code can be found on GitHub: <https://github.com/SamEdwardes/personal-blog/tree/main/blog/2022-04-14-fastapi-webpage-with-auth>.

If you you want to jump right to the solution check out the complete code below:

<i>main.py:</i> This is where all of our python code lives.

<CodeBlock language="python" title="main.py">{PythonMain}</CodeBlock>
