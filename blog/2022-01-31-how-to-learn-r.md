As a data scientist one of the most common questions I get from colleagues and clients is how to get started on learning R. There is a plethora of great options out there today. Some of which are paid, and some of which are free.

## My top reccomendation

My number one reccomendation is the **[Coursera Data Science Specialization (John Hopkins University)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhu-data-science)** course. This course will leave you with a solid foundation in base R, the tidyverse, the concept of tidy data, and concept of reproduceability, and many common data science algorithms.

Pros:

- Suitable for everyone. There is very little prerequiste knowledge required.
- Free and paid options (paid options provides a certificat upon completion).
- Engaging and intersting instructors.

Cons:

- Course was created several years ago. I cannot find the exact date, but the R eco system is growing rapidly and constanly changing. Some topics may be slightly out of date.
- Big time committment (estimated time is 11 months, for me it took about 10 months).
