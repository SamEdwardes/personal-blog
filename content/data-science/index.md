Data Science is my passion! I am currently pursuing a Masters of Data Science from UBC. Below are links to some of my personal projects and blog posts.

**Python Libraries**

- [pydatafaker](https://github.com/SamEdwardes/pydatafaker): A python package to create fake data with relationships between tables.
- [spaCyTextBlob](https://github.com/SamEdwardes/spaCyTextBlob): A TextBlob sentiment analysis pipeline component for spaCy.
- [jupydocs](https://github.com/SamEdwardes/jupydocs): Simple python package documentation with jupyter.
